## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sessions
The Session component consists of the following set of features: Create Session

#### The Session class
The Session Class encompasses several important attributes:
* `SessionNumber`: This unique identifier helps distinguish one session from another. It is an integral part of the Session class and is a primary key when searching for or referencing sessions within the system.

* `SessionStudents`: An essential component of every session is the list of students participating. The SessionStudents class keeps track of the students present in a particular session. This class allows for efficient management of attendance records and plays a vital role in generating attendance reports.

* `SessionRemark`: Sometimes, additional information about a session is necessary, such as special instructions, topics covered, or any other relevant remarks. The SessionRemark field offers the flexibility to include such notes.

The Session class also provides a set of getter methods that enable access to these attributes. For instance, you can retrieve the session number, list of students, or session remarks using these methods.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Session` and its respective fields.

![Session Class UML](images/SessionClassUML.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How the students are added to a session upon initialisation:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The `CreateSession` feature takes in arguments of varying number of student names.
- Pros:This choice offers a high degree of flexibility when it comes to adding students to a session. You can add any number of students when creating a session, which is essential for accommodating different class sizes and situations.
**Alternative 2:** An alternative design could involve creating two separate constructor methods within the `CreateSession` class. One constructor would be responsible for adding a student to an existing `SessionStudents`, and the other would take an entire `SessionStudents` object as an argument.
- Cons: This alternative introduces additional complexity in terms of validating user input and checking for null values upon execution. It may be less intuitive than the current approach.

By opting for the current choice (Alternative 1), the implementation remains straightforward and user-friendly, allowing for versatile usage scenarios. It ensures that users can efficiently create sessions and add students to them without unnecessary constraints or complications.

**Key Takeaway:** The chosen approach in the implementation of the `CreateSession` feature prioritises flexibility and ease of use for users, providing a more intuitive experience when managing class sessions and student attendance.

### Tasks
The Task component consists of the following set of features: Add Task, Delete Task and Update Progress.

#### The Task class
The Task Class is made up of a `TaskName`, `TaskDescription`, `date`, `TaskPriority`, `TaskProgress`, and a set of getter methods that corresponds to these fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Task` and its respective fields.

![Task Class UML](images/TaskClassUML.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How the status of a task is implemented:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `TaskProgress` Enum for Task Progress. Progress includes `not_started`, `pending`, `done`.
- Pros: This choice offers flexibility in representing task progress.
- Cons: It requires additional checks to validate user input and extensive unit testing.

**Alternative 2:** `isDone` Boolean for Task Completion.
- Cons: Only allows for a binary state, i.e., either the task is done or not.

### Grades
The Grade component consists of the following set of features: Edit Grade, Delete Grade and View Grade.

#### The Grade class
The Grade Class is made up of an `actualGrade`, `maxGrade`, `isGraded`, and a set of getter methods that corresponds to most of these fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Grade` and its respective fields.

![Grade Class UML](images/GradeClass UML.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How the assignment a grade is being given to is determined:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Grade` is a field in the `Assignment` it is being graded to.
- Pros: This choice makes it easier to ensure that each assignment only has one grade, and also makes it easier to manage multiple features related to an assignment.
- Cons: It requires additional time to add a grade to an assignment since the assignment needs to be obtained first.

**Alternative 2:** `Assignment` is a field in the `Grade` being given to it.
- Cons: It requires more checks to be done to ensure that each assignment only has one Grade.

**Alternative 3:** `Assignment` is a field in the `Grade` being given to it and vice versa.
- Cons: It increases coupling which increases the dependency of the classes.

### Comments
The Comment component consists of the following set of features: Edit Comment, Delete Comment and View Comment.

#### The Comment class
The Comment Class is made up of a `commentBody`, `isCommented`, and a set of getter methods that corresponds to most of these fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Comment` and its respective fields.

![Grade Class UML](images/CommentClass UML.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How the comment a grade is being given to is determined:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Comment` is a field in the `Assignment` it is being graded to.
- Pros: This choice makes it easier to ensure that each assignment only has one comment, and also makes it easier to manage multiple features related to an assignment.
- Cons: It requires additional time to add a comment to an assignment since the assignment needs to be obtained first.

**Alternative 2:** `Assignment` is a field in the `Comment` being given to it.
- Cons: It requires more checks to be done to ensure that each assignment only has one Comment.

**Alternative 3:** `Assignment` is a field in the `Comment` being given to it and vice versa.
- Cons: It increases coupling which increases the dependency of the classes.


### GradedTest
The GradedTest component is responsible for tracking and managing graded test scores of individuals. It includes features such as creating and updating graded test scores.

#### The GradedTest class
The GradedTest Class is made up of a `ReadingAssessment1`, `ReadingAssessment2`, `MidTerms`, `Finals`, and
`PracticalExam`, each representing a different aspect of an individual's graded test scores. GradedTest Class also have a set of getter methods that corresponds to those fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Task` and its respective fields.

![GradedTest Class UML](images/GradedTest UML.png)

#### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How to represent the scores of individuals:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilizing `String` for individual graded test score.
- Pros: This choice offers flexibility in representing graded tests (e.g Default value of `-`).
- Cons: It requires additional parsing to generate statistics of how the Avenger's students are doing (e.g average,
  highest, lowest score).

**Alternative 2:** Multiple constructors for `GradedTest`.
- Pros: Provides flexibility in how users can create a `GradedTest` object.
- Cons: Requires additional parsing. Different constructor will give different error messages.


### Consultations:

The Consultation component consists fo the following set of features: Create Consultation, Delete Consultation, Add
Student to a Consultation.

#### The Consultation Class

The Consultation Class is made up of a `LocalDate`, `LocalTime`, a `HashSet` of `Person` and a set of getter methods
that corresponds to these fields.

Below is a class diagram describing the implementation of `Consultation` and its respective fields.

<p align="center"><img src="images/ConsultationClassUMLDiagram.png"></p>
<p align="center">Consultation Class UML Diagram</p>

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How the students are stored to a consultation:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** Use Set<Person> to keep track of students in a consultation.
    * Pros: Stores only 1 instance of a unique person, no duplicates.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.


* **Alternative 2:** Use ArrayList<Person> to keep track of students.
    * Cons: We must ensure there are no duplicates with additional checks.

**Aspect: Adding students to a new or existing consultation:**

* **Alternative 1 (Current choice):** The `AddToConsult` feature creates a new Consultation object with updated student list
  * Pros: Defensive programming when entirely creating a new Consultation object without modifying previous object.
  * Cons: Require additional checking to inform exception cases.

* **Alternative 2:** `AddToConsult` directly manipulate the attribute `students` in a Consultation object.
  * Cons: Poor abstraction and room for errors.


### Commands
This section explains the general implementation of all commands. The implementation of all commands can be generally split into two main event flows: commands with their own specific command parser, and commands without one.

#### Parser Commands
This section explains the implementation and execution of commands that have their own parser.

Below is the sequence diagram for the execution of these commands (denoted by `XYZCommand`) after user input is sent to `LogicManager`. The execution of each of the command has been omitted due to their inherent differences and will be covered in their respective command sections below.

![Command Parser Sequence Diagram](images/CommandParserSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The user enters a command with the necessary parameters which is then passed to the `LogicManager`.

Step 2:
The `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser::parseCommand` for it to identify the type of command.

Step 3:
The `AddressBookParser` parses the user input and creates a command parser for that specific command. (denoted by `XYZCommandParser`)

Step 4:
The command parser is returned to the `AddressBookParser` which then calls `XYZCommandParser::parse` to parse the additional parameters.

Step 5:
The `XYZCommandParser` creates its respective command object (denoted by `XYZCommand`) and returns it to `LogicManager`.

Step 6:
The `LogicManager` calls `XYZCommand::execute` where the interaction between the command and the model is handled.

Step 7:
The `XYZCommand` creates a successful `CommandResult` and returns it to the UI.


#### Add Tasks Feature
This section explains the implementation of the Add Task feature via the `addtask` command.
The `AddTaskCommand` causes the specified Task to be added to the Task List in the application.
There is only one compulsory field which is the name of the task. There are several optional fields such as the description, priority and deadline.

Below is the sequence diagram outlining the execution of `AddTaskCommand`.

![AddTaskCommand sequence diagram](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1:
The `LogicManager` invokes `AddTaskCommand::execute`, which in turn calls `Model::addTask`.

Step 2:
The `Model` will invoke `addTask` in `TaskListBook`, which in turn calls `add` in `TaskList` to add it to the list.

Step 3:
The `Model` will call its own `updateFilteredTaskList` method in order to update the model's filter to display all tasks.

Step 4:
The `AddTaskCommand` then continues its execution as defined by [this](#parser-commands) sequence diagram.


##### Design Considerations:
**Aspect: How we execute the AddTaskCommand:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Let the `LogicManager` pass the model to the command to execute.
    * Pros: Promotes information hiding since we do not need to expose the model to the `AddTaskCommand`.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the model in the `AddTaskCommand` itself.
    * Pros: Easier to debug.
    * Cons: The `AddTaskCommand` might be able to call other methods in the model.
