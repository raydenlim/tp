### Project: F.A.K.E.J.A.R.V.I.S.

F.A.K.E.J.A.R.V.I.S. is a brownfield project built on Address Book 3 (AB3), with the intention to help CS1101S Avengers manage their Teaching Assistant (TA) duties.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature 1**: Added the Graded Test component
  * **What it does**: Enables users to view the graded tests of their students at a glance.
  * **Justification**: Currently in CS1101S, the Avengers would have to navigate through the many folders in Canvas to access their student's results 1 by 1. This process is time-consuming as the grades are not consolidated in one single platform.
  * **Highlights**: The graded tests are displayed within the Student's card, enabling the Avengers to retrieve their student's grades at a glance. This provides a super convenient way for Avengers to better track their student's performance.
  * **Credits**: No reuse of code or third-party libraries used.

* **New Feature 2**: Added the ability to edit graded tests.
  * **What it does**: Enables users to dynamically edit their student's graded test scores.
  * **Justification**: The ability to edit graded test scores is essential to accommodate situations where grades may need to be adjusted, updated, or corrected.
  * **Highlights**: As the fields are optional, users can easily modify the scores for individual components of a student's graded test, without having to key in the scores for the unconcerned fields. Moreover, graded test scores can be edited  via the `edit` and `editgradedtest` command.
  * **Credits**: No reuse of code or third-party libraries used.
