## Quick start

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://www.openlogic.com/openjdk-downloads?field_java_parent_version_target_id=406&field_operating_system_target_id=All&field_architecture_target_id=All&field_java_package_target_id=401) or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `fakejarvis.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2324S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/releases). _[Coming Soon]_

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your F.A.K.E.J.A.R.V.I.S..

4. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar fakejarvis.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the image below should appear in a few seconds. (Currently, the image below is a mock-up of our GUI) Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>

    ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * `viewtasks` : Lists all tasks.

    * `createconsult d/10/10/2023 tt/15:00 n/John Doe n/ Foo Bar` : Creates a consultation with the students `John Doe` and `Foo Bar`.

    * `createsession 3 n/John Doe` : Creates a `No. 3` Session with the student `John Doe`.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command and the [Command Format](#command-format) for the specifications of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Command Format

**The commands in the user guide adopt the following conventions:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addtask tn/TASK_NAME`, `TASK_NAME` is a parameter which can be specified, such as `addtask tn/Do User Guide`.


* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `tn/TASK_NAME [td/do before feedback]` can be used as `tn/Do User Guide td/do before feedback` or as `tn/Do user Guide`.


* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[n/NAME]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `n/John Doe`, `n/John Doe n/ Foo Bar` etc.


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `tn/TASK_NAME td/TASK_DESCRIPTION`, `td/TASK_DESCRIPTION tn/TASK_NAME` is also acceptable.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.


* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous F.A.K.E.J.A.R.V.I.S. home folder.

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
